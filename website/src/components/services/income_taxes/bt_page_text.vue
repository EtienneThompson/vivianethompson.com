      <span class="font-weight-bold">Taxes come once a year, right?</span><br/>
      Wrong - taxes affect a business each time the business makes a purchase.
      Why? Because in business, purchases need to be both ordinary and necessary
      to be deductible. These need to be commonly accepted in your trade
      of business although they don't need to be indispensable to be considered
      necessary.<br/><br/>
      When you wait until the end of the year to create financial statements,
      you have no idea what your taxes will be. Being prepared is essential
      to minimizing taxes and penalties assessed by the tax authorities.<br/><br/>
      In addition, a business has many types of taxes to monitor, file returns,
      and pay on time. Trying to wade the arena alone can be foolish because
      there are so many deadlines that it's easy to miss them. Despite its
      nickname, the IRS is not your benevolent uncle!<br/><br/>
      Working with a knowledgeable professional can make all the difference
      between always trying to catch up and feeling in control.<br/><br/>

      A successful business can be defined in many ways, however in its
      simplest term it is a business that is profitable for its owners.
      Unfortunately, most small business owners don't know whether they
      are profitable. To many, the only indication of their profitability
      is the growing size of their balance.<br/><br/>
      Our firm helps small businesses build systems and procedures using
      the "bottom up" approach to answer fundamental business questions:
      Is my business profitable? Am I doing better than last year? How
      can I grow my business? Am I in compliance with Uncle Sam?<br/><br/>
      Our mission is to make sure that our clients sleep at night.<br/><br/>
      How do we help you achieve these goals? First, we look at your accounting
      procedures and fix them. Then, we help you become a better
      businessperson or your people in becoming better associates. We
      constantly assess your needs and strive for better results.<br/><br/>
      We provide accounting and bookkeeping solutions to free you up to
      do what you do best: talk to your customers, sell your goods, negotiate
      with your vendors, or take your day off.<br/><br/>
      Last but not least, we provide you with business advice based on
      data analysis (budgets, for example) so that you can implement
      improvement and make more money.<br/><br/>

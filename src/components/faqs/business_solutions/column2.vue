        I will provide you with critical research and so that you have
        a number of choices available while advising you on the best

        As a self-employed business owner with no employees, you can
        have a SEP (Simplified Employee Pension) plan in which you can
        defer your income tax-free just like in a regular 401(k).
        I will help you with the set-up and refer you to appropriate
        resources.

      </v-expansion-panel-header>
      <v-expansion-panel-content>
        Absolutely. In order to grow a business such as adding employees,
        opening a new location, or changing product mix, you need
        sophisticated financial analysis, in other words: somebody
        should "do the math."
        <br />
        <br />I will provide you with detailed financial analysis that you
        can use because it's tailored to your business, it uses your
        historical financial numbers and answers the questions you are
        asking. My worksheets are clear and concise and are built to
        be easily read.

      </v-expansion-panel-header>
      <v-expansion-panel-content>
        Absolutely. Budgets are very important because they help you
        benchmark how you are doing as well as help you make financial
        decisions that are beneficial to your business.
        <br />
        <br />Many business owners operate "by the seat of their pants"
        which is one of the reasons why so many businesses fail. Having
        a professional like myself prepare a budget will pay for itself
        by providing you multiple benefits.

      </v-expansion-panel-header>
      <v-expansion-panel-content>
        Absolutely. There are many parts to a business plan, one of which
        being the financial reports: Income statements (past and future),
        balance sheets, cash flow forecasts, etc. The key to a useful
        business plan is to create statements that are realistic and
        yet show the true potential of your business.
        <br />
        <br />The rest of the business plan analyzes markets, competition
        and many other essential parts of a business. Getting help
        with other professionals may be required.

      </v-expansion-panel-header>
      <v-expansion-panel-content>
        You are not alone! Through audit procedures and financial
        analysis, I can review your accounts and attempt to identify
        the theft. I can also help you set up safeguards so that future
        problems are eliminated or at least minimized.
        <br />
        <br />I will also help you design employee procedures and policies
        that will minimize the risks of theft.

      <v-expansion-panel-content>
        I most often work at the client's office because that's where
        all your records are. no critical information leaves that office
        so that the integrity of the data is safeguarded. For certain
        financial analysis and with your permission, I may be able to
        work from my home office.

        lasts from one to three hours and is at the speed of the user.
        The training is completely geared to your needs and we discuss
        only the topics that are of interest to you, using your data
        file so that the information is pertinent to your organization.

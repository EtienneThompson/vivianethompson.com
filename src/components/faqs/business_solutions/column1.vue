      <v-expansion-panel-content>
        Small businesses need the expertise of a business manager but not
        on a full time basis. As your periodic business manager, I will work
        and be available a few hours a month or be available for one-time
        special projects. You call me when you need me!

      </v-expansion-panel-header>
      <v-expansion-panel-content>
        A controller is the head of the accounting department of a business.
        The accounting staff is responsible for the day-to-day accounting
        tasks for the business. The controller supervises the staff, controls
        the finance of the firm, and is the liason with upper management.
        <br />
        <br />A business manager does all the functions of the controller and,
        because the firm is smaller, he/she is involved in all other financial
        aspects of the business from negotiating contracts to human resources
        activites and of course, taking care of the accounting and bookkeeping,
        thereby doing many tasks that are performed by the owner.

      <v-expansion-panel-content>
        Small business owners do not need to wear all the hats. A business
        manager takes over all of the accounting and financial tasks to
        leave you free to concentrate on what you do best: your business.

        It will free up your time currently used in bookkeeping and
        administrative tasks while giving you comfort that the work
        is done by a professional accountant. You retain control while
        gaining the flexibility of utilizing a professional only when
        needed.

        I have many years of experience in "cleaning up" accounting problems.
        I'll reconcile your bank accounts (several years back if necessary),
        fix the general ledger, and do any other work needed to clean
        up your accounting. Although there is a cost associated with the
        clean-up, there are many hidden costs of not cleaning up your
        records.
        <br />
        <br />Here are a few examples of those hidden costs: penalties and interest
        on late payment of taxes, missed deductions leading to a higher tax
        liability, late filing of tax returns leading to a higher chance
        of audit, decrease of apparent value of the business should it be
        sold, etc....

      </v-expansion-panel-header>
      <v-expansion-panel-content>
        Absolutely. The first decision is to identify which QuickBooks
        product you need. You can read their website (QuickBooks.com)
        or you can ask me and get an immediate answer so you can make
        the right decision. Buying the correct software can save you
        a lot of time and hassle later!
        <br />
        <br />I'll transfer your Quicken data, properly set up the accounts
        and reports, and train you staff (or yourself) on how to use
        the software.

      <v-expansion-panel-content>
        QuickBooks is a wonderful software for small business. However,
        as any other software, it works better when used as intended.
        As soon as I have reviewed how you are currently using it, I'll
        be able to make recommendations about ways you can improve the
        data entry, the reporting and use of tools such as inventory
        and fixed assets.

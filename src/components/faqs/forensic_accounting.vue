                <v-expansion-panel-content>
                  As a Certified Forensic Accountant, I have acquired unique skills
                  combining knowledge, experience, and education to apply accounting,
                  auditing, and investigative skills to uncover truth, form legal opinions,
                  and assist in investigations. Forensic accountants provide litigation
                  support to attorneys as expert witness for example. They also use
                  their skills in investigative accounting such as scrutinizing possible
                  illegal financial activites such as white collar crimes.

                <v-expansion-panel-content>
                  I analyze relevant business records, reconstruct books and interview
                  involved parties. In doing so, I uncover the facts to determine whether
                  financial wrongdoing has occurred, how long it has been in progress,
                  how it was concealed and the value of the impact. Additionally, I
                  am able to quantify losses as a result of the fraud, helping to
                  drive recovery, litigation and insurance claims strategies.

                <v-expansion-panel-content>
                  Start an investigation by hiring a forensic accountant to analyze
                  and understand how the person is stealing, what is being stolen,
                  how much and for how long. A strategy should be used to explain the
                  investigation and to provide the necessary documents so that the
                  person(s) are not alerted. After the results of the investigation
                  are know, you will be able to assess the damage and take appropriate
                  steps towards prosecution.

                  When employees percieve that companies are actively seeking out fraud
                  and punishing offenders, they are less likely to commit fraud. Background
                  checks are an important part of the hiring and promotion process.
                  This data can be used to make better hiring decisions, as it can
                  alert management to factors that might make an individual more likely
                  to participate in a fraud.
